The dataset comprises accounting data from 8,262 distinct companies recorded during the period spanning from 1999 to 2018.\n\nAccording to the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), a company in the American market is deemed bankrupt under two circumstances. Firstly, if the firm\u0027s management files for Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, indicating an intention to \u0022reorganize\u0022 its business. In this case, the company\u0027s management continues to oversee day-to-day operations, but significant business decisions necessitate approval from a bankruptcy court. Secondly, if the firm\u0027s management files for Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, indicating a complete cessation of operations and the company going out of business entirely.\n\nIn this dataset, the fiscal year prior to the filing of bankruptcy under either Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 is labeled as \u0022Bankruptcy\u0022 (1) for the subsequent year. Conversely, if the company does not experience these bankruptcy events, it is considered to be operating normally (0). The dataset is complete, without any missing values, synthetic entries, or imputed added values.\n\nThe resulting dataset comprises a total of 78,682 observations of firm-year combinations. To facilitate model training and evaluation, the dataset is divided into three subsets based on time periods. The training set consists of data from 1999 to 2011, the validation set comprises data from 2012 to 2014, and the test set encompasses the years 2015 to 2018. The test set serves as a means to assess the predictive capability of models in real-world scenarios involving unseen cases.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n| Variable Name           | Description                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| X1                      | Current assets - All the assets of a company that are expected to be sold or used as a result of standard |\n|                         | business operations over the next year                                                                    |\n| X2                      | Cost of goods sold - The total amount a company paid as a cost directly related to the sale of products  |\n| X3                      | Depreciation and amortization - Depreciation refers to the loss of value of a tangible fixed asset over   |\n|                         | time (such as property, machinery, buildings, and plant).
