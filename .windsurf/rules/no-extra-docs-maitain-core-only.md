Only maintain the following documentation files:
• README.md
• PROJECT_STATUS.md
• PERFECT_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md (with checklist)
• COMPLETE_PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md

Do not create any additional .md files under any circumstances. Always update and adjust the existing core documents.
Maintain logical order—edit sections in the correct place, not just append to the end.
Keep all documentation synchronized and up to date with every change.
No duplication of information between files. Every piece of info must live in exactly one place.
