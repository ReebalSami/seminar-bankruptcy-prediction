NO SHORTCUTS. Do not suggest throwing out flawed scripts or starting from scratch. Fix the existing methodology and make it sound. No “Option A/B” menus—deliver one complete, professional path and commit to it. No hedging or “it depends.” Provide the full analysis and implementation steps. Only delete a script if it is truly obsolete or unnecessary; otherwise, repair and improve it immediately.
